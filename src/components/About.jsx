      <p>
        I'm a passionate MERN Full Stack Software Engineer. I recently graduated
        from Per Scholas, where I developed expertise in full-stack web
        development with technologies like JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, and
        MongoDB. I love building dynamic, user-centered applications, focusing
        on both intuitive UIs and efficient back-end systems. Outside of coding,
        I enjoy gardening, cooking, and teaching my children new skills. Iâ€™m
        excited to continue growing as a developer and using technology to
        create meaningful solutions.{" "}
